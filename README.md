# Guardian
*A friendly and feature-rich bot made to serve as an all-in-one solution for Discord servers.*

> Unfortunately, Guardian is not an open-source project; this repository serves as a "public-view" to allow users to use the [issues tab](https://github.com/coopersully/guardian-public/issues) to suggest additions and new features as well as report bugs and exploits they may encounter while using Guardian. If you're looking for any of Guardian's resources, I've included a few links below for quick and easy access.
